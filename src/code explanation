## Code Structure Overview

### Header File (`grid.h`)

- **Purpose:** Defines the `Grid` class, declares its private variables, and provides an empty constructor.
- **Constructor:** The empty constructor allows for variable initialization within the class. Additional variables (like those used in `Initialize()`) must be declared elsewhere, such as in `grid.cpp`.
- **Method Declarations:** `Initialize()` and `Print()` methods are declared with `void` return types, as they do not return values.

### Implementation File (`grid.cpp`)

- **Method Definitions:** The actual functionality for `Initialize()` and `Print()` is implemented here.
- **Object Creation:** A `Grid` object is created, its variables are assigned values, and the `Initialize()` method is called.
- **Method Details:**
    - `Initialize()`: Sets all grid elements to `0`.
    - `Print()`: Displays the grid in the console, formatting elements with spaces.

### Main File (`main.cpp`)

- **Integration:** Brings together all components. A `Grid` object is created (identical to the one in `grid.cpp`) and its output is printed.

### Best Practices

- **Separation of Concerns:** The header file is used for declaring classes, constructors, and methods, while their implementations are placed in separate source files. This avoids redundant declarations and keeps `#include` statements clean.
- **Usage:** To use a class or method, simply `#include "header.h"` in your source file.

### Additional Functionality

- In `grid.cpp`, the `Draw()` method is implemented to render rectangles on the game screen. The color is determined by `cell_size` as an index in the `std::vector<Colors>` structure.
